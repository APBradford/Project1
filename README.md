# DevOps Core Fundamental Project

This project is to create a Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) application created in python. The application will be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance and the database layer server will also be hosted in AWS using the RDS service. The front end of the application will be written using the Flask python framework.

My application is for a triathlon training tracking app. The user will be able to enter/veiw training data for running, swimming and cycling indiviudally. The application will then automatically create a fourth table, which takes data for each indivual activity and show the training totals for that week.
