# DevOps Core Fundamental Project

This project is to create a Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) application created in python. The application will be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance and the database layer server will also be hosted in AWS using the RDS service. The front end of the application will be written using the Flask python framework.

My application is for a triathlon training tracking app. The user will be able to enter/veiw training data for running, swimming and cycling indiviudally. The application will then automatically create a fourth table, which takes data for each indivual activity and show the training totals for that week.

The MVP for the application will be having the pages, tables and CRUD features for Cycling and Training week.

# ERD Diagram

Below is the ERD digaram for the MySQL database. It shows the one to many relationship between the Cycling, Running, Swimming tables with the training week tables. The yellow highlighted tables are the MVP.

As the project is only a few days long, the project sprints were 2 days long. User stories were written for each backlog item and MoSCoW priotisation was done. An example is as follows:
